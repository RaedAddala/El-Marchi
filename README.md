# El-Marchi

"El-Marchi" ( means The Market in Tunsian Arabic Dialect ) is an E-commerce platform dedicated for everything related to trade.

El-Marchi includes:

- an E-commerce Platform equivalent to an online Bazzar. ( yess bargain is possible )
- a map showcasing your local markets, malls and Bazzars, each with its own speciality.
- an event management platform dedicated to manage events such as _sale seasons_, _exhibitions_, _fairs_, _auctions_, and other trade related big events.
- online auction system.

Of course for now this is only a projection on what we imagine this platform to be.
